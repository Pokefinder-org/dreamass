DreamAss Syntaxhighlighting for KDE editor components.

Install this in your katepart syntax directory and all applications like KWrite, Kate, KDevelop will display DreamAss sources with highlighting.
On my system the katepart syntax directory for the current user is located here:

~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax

Try searchin for 'syntax.template' if your distribution moved it somewhere else.
